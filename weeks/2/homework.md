# Due Next Thursday by 11:59PM

Build a working, live website, that's available to view at http://*your Github username*.github.io. You should:

1. Create at least 3 HTML pages, connected by a common navigation element (like a menu or navbar).
2. Make this website your own. It could your personal profile page, blog, list of recipes, or any other idea you might have. Use the HTML guidelines as listed below.
3. The browser tab should display a meaningful title describing what the page is about (e.g. "About Me", "Brian's Recipes", etc.)
4. Link to a separate stylesheet file that's shared across all pages on your site (see CSS guidelines below).
5. Sync your code into your GitHub.com account. The repository should be named *(your Github username)*.github.io. For example, my Github username is *eng*, so my repository name for this assignment should be *eng.github.io*. This will automatically make your page available on the public Internet at that address (e.g. http://eng.github.io/).

## HTML Guidelines

You should use these elements at least once, and use proper indentation and spacing:

* h1
* h2
* p
* ul
* li
* a
* body
* html
* title
* head

You should apply CSS styles three different ways:

* By element
* By ID
* By class

## CSS Guidelines

Add visual styles that apply good design principles and that are responsive across a variety of devices and platforms.

You should:

- Link to the Bootstrap CSS framework in your HEAD tag
- Utilize the Bootstrap grid system to create a logical separation in your design elements (e.g. header, content, sidebar, footer) on medium-sized (992px wide and up) devices and up
- Ensure that on smaller sized devices, like a tablet or phone, your site is still usable. Content should be stacked.
- Use at least one of Bootstrap's built-in CSS classes to style HTML elements. Examples:
  - Make a link look like a button
  - Style a table
  - Manipulate an image (make it square, circle, etc. or responsive in size)
- Use at least one other Bootstrap design component
  - Nav
  - Navbar
  - Label
  - Alert
  - Etc.
- *Use your own CSS in addition to Bootstrap, in order to customize the look of your site. Override at least 3 of Bootstrap's style rules.*
- Use Font Awesome and/or Google Fonts to add custom typography/icongraphy to your site.

Commit and sync your changes to your Github account no later than 11:59pm on Thursday.
