# Not graded! But use for practice!

Create a new sub-folder of your code folder, and name it *weather*.

In your weather app, you should create two files:

- index.html
- weather.js

Using `https://github.com/kiei924-fall16/weather` to help guide you along (do not attempt to "clone" or "fork" this repository - just use it to help you get started - download it as a zip file, if you like) you should:

- Link the Bootstrap CSS and JS files to index.html
- Link weather.js to your index.html page, and write code in weather.js so that clicking a button on the page retrieves weather data from Forecast.io and displays it on screen. You should include (at least):
  - Current weather conditions
  - 3-day daily forecast
