**1. Setup Your Development Environment**

In case you didn't before the first class, [follow the instructions to install all necessary development tools](/kiei924-fall15/workbook/setup).

**2. Practice!

No other homework to turn in, but Week 2's homework will be to create a website. So practice what we did in class.
