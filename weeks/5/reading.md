Note: these videos are slightly out-of-date, as JavaScript development moves very quickly, and I have not had a chance to update them. Here are the significant differences between what we are doing in class vs. the videos:

- The directory structure is slightly different. In the videos, the JavaScript source files are in the `js` directory. In our starter project, the source files are in the `src` directory.
- In the videos, we use `gulp` to start the development server. Use `npm start` instead.
- In the videos, we use the `movieData` and `lotsMoreMovies` variables to reference the sample movie data. Use `SampleData.movies` and `LotsMoreMovies.movies` instead.
