# Week 4 Homework - Graded (20 points)

### Due Date: Next Thursday, 11:59pm

This week's homework is to build two JavaScript applications. Both applications should live in a single GitHub repository, named *week4*. For grading, the assignment will be automatically downloaded from your GitHub account, so **the name of the repository matters** -- make sure your submission lives at https://github.com/your-username/week4.

Minimum directory structure for your submission:

    Your Code Directory
    -- week4
      -- todo
        -- index.html
        -- todo.js
      -- poker
        -- index.html
        -- poker.js
        
* A "To-Do" list JavaScript app (10 points)
  * A single HTML page and JS file. This page should be a simple "list" application, where items can be removed from a list. 
  * The items on the list should be hard-coded HTML elements on the page.
  * Each item should be able to be removed via a link or button corresponding to the item.
  * Some examples are:
    * To-do list
    * Shopping list
    * Recipes or restaurants to try
    * Anything else! 
* "Poker" JavaScript app (10 points)
  * A jQuery-based application that simulates the dealing of five random playing cards when a button is pressed (e.g. "Deal")
  * Use https://github.com/kiei924-fall16/poker as a starting point
  * Card images can be found using the following convention: http://golearntocode.com/images/cards/5_of_diamonds.png
  * You can use Boostrap's *img-responsive* helper class to make the cards not so huge :)

Commit and sync your code to your *week4* GitHub repository by 11:59pm on Monday, December 7.
