# KIEI-924 Fall 2016 Final Project

### Due Date: Friday, December 9, 11:59pm

**Core Requirements (30 points total)**

The team you hired to build your startup, Buyflix, just secured funding on their own world-changing Uber for cats idea, and walked out, leaving you high and dry. You’ve got three weeks to present your product to investors and you can’t find a new developer. You're now stuck having to finish it yourself. These features are still left to do:

- (7 points) Ability to sort the movies (alphabetically and by release date) and have the sortbar reflect the current sort order
- (7 points) Data visualization: either a chart that shows number of releases by month or a Google Map to show "where to watch" (i.e. movie theaters) 
- (7 points) Add data for 2014 movies (currently only movies released in 2015 are in the database)
- (7 points) Host the data and site live on the Internet using Firebase
- (2 points) Commit and sync your code to a GitHub repository in your account named `final`. Add a `README.md` file to your repository indicating the live Internet address.

The developers have left what they've done so far at http://github.com/kiei924-fall16/buyflix-final. The rest is up to you!
