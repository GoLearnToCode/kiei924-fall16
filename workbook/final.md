# KIEI-924 Fall 2016 Final Project

### Due Date: Friday, December 9, 11:59pm

**Core Requirements (30 points total)**

The developers of your startup, Buyflix, have left you high and dry. You’ve got three weeks to present your startup to investors and you can’t find a new developer. These features are still left to do:

- Sorting the movies (A-Z, by release date)
- Chart to show releases by month
- Add 2016 data

Commit and sync your code to a GitHub repository in your account named `final`. None of this needs to be available in any "live" environment; it should simply run on your own computer.
